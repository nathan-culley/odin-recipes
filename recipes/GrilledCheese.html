        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The grilled cheese sandwich is a classic--who doesn't have fond memories of eating a hot grilled cheese on a cold day? While the concept it simple, there are a few tricks that can really step up your grilled cheese game.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slics of bread (recommended: sourdough, potato, or buttermilk)</li>
            <li>2 slices of cheese (recommended: American)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp of butter (mayonnaise can be used instead)</li>
            <li>Sliced turkey or ham (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the butter in a frying pan and put it on the stove on medium heat. If using mayonnaise instead, spread it on one side of each of the slices of bread.</li>
            <li>Once the butter is melted and/or the frying pan has been fully heated at medium heat, placed the two slices of bread (mayo side down if applicable) onto the skillet, making sure the butter gets onto the whole bottom side of the bread.</li>
            <li>Add a slice of cheese to each slice of bread. Wait until the cheese is slightly soften and the bread is beginning to brown, approximately 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Use a spatula to put the two slices of bread together with the cheese inside. Continue to cook the sandwich on the pan until the bottom is golden brown, then flip and cook the other side to the same golden brown color. Remove the sandwich and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
