        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Santa Fe chicken is a delicious southwestern meal that's filling, nutritious, and low-calorie. It goes well on rice, a tortilla, or just by itself. Best of all, this recipe takes advantage of the Instant Pot's incredible abilities to make this recipe quick and easy. Instead of taking hours like a slow cooker would, this recipe allows you to make Santa Fe Chicken in barely a half-hour of total prep and cooking time.
